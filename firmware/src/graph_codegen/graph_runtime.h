// Placeholder for future graph runtime helpers used by generated patterns.
// The generated code currently relies on the existing firmware types
// (PatternParameters, PatternState, PatternOutput, etc.) that are declared
// in the surrounding firmware includes. This header exists to provide a
// stable include path for the code generator and is intentionally lean so
// it does not pull additional dependencies into the build unless enabled
// via USE_GENERATED_* flags.
