## Overview

Important project-specific override (K1.node1)
- We do NOT use Jira/Linear for planning or issue tracking in this repository.
- The source of truth for tasks is Taskmaster under `.taskmaster/`, with the active task list at `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.
- Anywhere these docs mention “Linear/Jira issues,” read that as “Taskmaster tasks” with MCP access scoped to `.taskmaster/` files.

Complete technical documentation for integrating **Conductor.build** as a multi-agent workspace orchestration platform for K1.node1. This directory contains:

1. **Master Brief** — High-level architecture and project scope
2. **Implementation Guide** — Quick start guide and Phase 1 deployment
3. **Annexes A–E** — Detailed technical specifications and operational runbooks

---

## Documents at a Glance

### 📋 Master Brief
**File**: `master_brief.md`

Executive overview aligned to K1.node1 (firmware + webapp + device). Defines:
- Conductor execution model (isolated Git worktrees per agent)
- Automation hooks (setup, run, archive contract)
- MCP integration policy (least-privilege allowlists)
- Acceptance criteria for implementation

**Start here** if you're new to Conductor or this project.

---

### 🚀 Implementation Guide
**File**: `implementation_guide.md`

Phase 1 deployment procedure with quick start (5 min). Covers:
- Prerequisites validation (Node ≥20, Git, PlatformIO)
- `.env` setup (API keys for GitHub, Taskmaster integration paths, K1 device, etc.)
- Local Conductor installation and initialization
- Test workspace creation and validation
- Phase 2 agent role workflows (Feature, Bugfix, Test, Release, Research)
- MCP enablement checklist
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

**Start here** to deploy Conductor locally.

### 📚 Annexes (Detailed Specifications)

#### **Annex A: Integration Patterns**
**File**: `annexes/annex_a_integration_patterns.md`

Describes how Conductor agents interact with external systems:
- **Version control**: Git worktree + PR flow, diff viewer
- **IDEs**: Conductor as orchestration layer (not replacement)
- **Task tracking**: Taskmaster MCP (reads/writes `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`) for task context + status updates
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions feedback loop (logs → agent → retry)
- **Device API**: Real-time validation (OTA deploy, metrics capture, baselines)
- **Knowledge bases**: Notion/Confluence for research findings
- **Ports**: `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` binding per workspace (prevents collisions)

**Read this** to understand how agents collaborate with K1 infrastructure.

---

#### **Annex B: Scalability & Resource Constraints**
**File**: `annexes/annex_b_scalability.md`

K1.node1-specific capacity planning and bottleneck analysis:
- **Agent concurrency**: Max 6–8 workspaces on 16GB RAM
- **Device contention**: Single ESP32-S3; OTA uploads must serialize (nonconcurrent mode)
- **Workspace isolation cost**: ~6 MB per workspace (cached deps via symlinks)
- **Build parallelism**: Multiple agents can compile firmware simultaneously (shared .pio/ cache)
- **Failover strategy**: Device offline = retry 3× then escalate
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, alerting rules

**Read this** if you're concerned about performance or scaling limits.

---

#### **Annex C: Deployment Strategy**
**File**: `annexes/annex_c_deployment_strategy.md`

Multi-agent orchestration architecture and delegation patterns:
- **Hub-and-spoke model**: Conductor is hub; workspaces are spokes
- **Stigmergy**: Agents communicate via shared git artifacts (status.md, findings.md)
- **Failure recovery**: Checkpointed diffs, revert strategies, redundancy
- **Escalation ladder**: Auto-retry → agent re-prompt → human review
- **24/7 high availability**: Future 2-node setup with active-active failover
- **CI/CD integration**: Pre-merge gates, feedback loop, auto-merge policies

**Read this** for deployment architecture and disaster recovery.

---

#### **Annex D: Domain Runbooks**
**File**: `annexes/annex_d_domain_runbooks.md`

Workflow specifications for each agent role:
- **Feature Agent** — New patterns/features (30 min turnaround)
- **Bugfix Agent** — Bug diagnosis and fixes (45 min turnaround)
- **Optimization Agent** — Performance tuning (60 min turnaround)
- **Test Agent** — Device validation (5 min per run)
- **Release Agent** — Build & publish artifacts (10 min)
- **Research Agent** — Knowledge synthesis (120 min)

Each role includes: workflow steps, success criteria, escalation rules, checklists.

**Read this** to understand what each agent type does and how to use them.

---

#### **Annex E: Security & MCP Access Controls**
**File**: `annexes/annex_e_security_access.md`

Least-privilege security model for multi-agent environments:
- **MCP allowlists**:
  - GitHub API (repo:read/write, actions:read)
  - Taskmaster (task:read/write restricted to `.taskmaster/` scope)
  - K1 Device API (pattern:read/write, device:read)
  - Sentry (read-only monitoring)
  - Notion (page:read/write, database:read)
- **Workspace hygiene**: `.env` copied on setup, deleted on archive
- **Secrets management**: Never committed; stored in `~/.conductor/config`
- **Audit logging**: MCP operations logged to `~/.conductor/audit.log`
- **Incident response**: Key revocation, spillage recovery, workspace cleanup

**Read this** before granting MCP permissions or running agents with sensitive data access.

## Configuration File

**Location**: `conductor.json` (repo root)

Production-ready configuration with K1.node1-specific customizations:
- Setup hook: installs deps (Node, PlatformIO, etc.)
- Run hook: targets (`web`, `fw:build`, `fw:upload`, `test:pattern`, `test:integration`)
- Archive hook: cleans secrets and build artifacts
- MCP servers: GitHub, Taskmaster, K1 device, Sentry, Notion
- Port binding: `$CONDUCTOR_PORT` assignment (prevents collisions)
- Run serialization: `nonconcurrent` mode (prevents simultaneous OTA uploads)

---

## Getting Started (3 Steps)

1. **Read** `master_brief.md` (5 min) — understand the system
2. **Follow** `implementation_guide.md` (15 min) — set up locally
3. **Deploy** first test workspace (10 min) — validate everything works

**Total**: ~30 minutes to working Conductor setup.
