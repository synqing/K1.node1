## 💡 Why These Additions Matter

The original guide provided the "what" and "how" of Builder.io's tools. These additions provide:
- The **"what if"** (troubleshooting)
- The **"how much"** (ROI and metrics)
- The **"which one"** (decision tree)
- The **"right now"** (starter kit and cheatsheet)
- The **"safely"** (security and accessibility)
- The **"together"** (team workflows)

This transforms the guide from a reference document into a complete implementation toolkit that addresses real-world production needs.
