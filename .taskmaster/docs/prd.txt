- Code quality: clang-tidy 0 high-severity
- Test coverage: ≥95%

===== WORKSTREAM C: QA & VALIDATION =====

TEAM: 1 QA engineer
RESPONSIBILITIES: CI/CD, test infrastructure, metrics, decision package

SETUP CI/CD PIPELINE (Nov 6-7):
- Configure GitHub Actions for firmware build
- Configure GitHub Actions for webapp tests
- Setup PlatformIO CI
- Verify all tests pass
- Success: CI/CD green, 0 failures

SETUP TEST INFRASTRUCTURE (Nov 6-10):

- Success: 0 regressions, all patterns stable

PREPARE DECISION PACKAGE (Nov 11-13):
- Collect all Phase 2D1 validation metrics
- Collect all Graph PoC validation metrics
- Compile Go/No-Go criteria checklist
- Create performance comparison (before/after)
