# Tooling Ecosystem

Standard tools:
- Figma: Primary design and prototyping tool. Store links and version tags.
- Builder.io: No-code page prototyping for marketing/ops; link prototypes under `design/06-research-prototypes/`.
- MCPs: Model Context Protocol agents for docs and operational automations; reference `.kiro/` artifacts.

Design system management:
- Source of truth: `design/` directory + Figma Libraries.
- Sync: Export tokens/components as needed; engineers map tokens to Tailwind.

Collaboration:
- Weekly sync + lightweight RFCs in `design/03-guides/`.
- Use issue templates for component requests and changes.

Setup notes:
- Accounts and access documented in `design/07-tools/`.
- For Figma libraries, include component identifiers that match code component names.
- For Builder.io, maintain environment tags and publish targets.
